# Software Development

At Child Mind Institute, I work on the [Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC)](https://fcp-indi.github.io/) at the Computational Imaging Lab.

# Research

### Cross-Pipeline Reproducibility

As part of C-PAC development, we evaluated preprocessing methods across different packages, including [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/) and [XCP](https://xcpengine.readthedocs.io/), and expanded C-PAC configuration options to enhance cross-pipeline reproducibility.

### Monkey Tissue Segmention using U-Net

Supervised by Ting Xu, I developed a deep learning model U-Net to segment tissues with macaque fMRI data.

### Connectivity-based Shared Response Model

Collaborated with Jae Wook Cho and Ting Xu, I applied shared response model on connectivity data for behavior and movie prediction.

### Deep Learning in Visual Science

When I worked as a research assistant at [the Hood Visual Science Lab](https://hoodvisualscience.psychology.columbia.edu/) of Columbia University, I applied deep learning models to detect glaucoma and enhanced model generalizability across different datasets.
